      <p>I came to the industry after a near death experience, I was tending a bar in Pacific Palisades and when I went
        up to a liqour room
        to restock the bar the gas tank fell on me and went off loudly spitting gas, and leaving me stranded in the
        tight space thinking I am without a doubt going to die underneath
        all those vodka bottles :) I was thinking about programming before but after this incident I finally completely
        changed my direction towards
        it and I have never looked back.

      <p>I have a background in psychology, political science, and international relations. In addition, I worked as a
        DJ for 12
        years and as a yoga instructor. I did a lot of searching and inner work and here I am. Programming for me is a
        way for us to
        connect not only within our countries but also internationally, to get access to things we couldnt access
        before, and to erase
        the walls that we put or maybe that someone put for us. <span class="abril">Coding is like music, like art - it
          does not see your nationality, your race, your religion,
          your language, or your gender. You are one with every single person who build things before you and who will
          continue building them
          after you are long gone. It is a beautiful thing.</span>
